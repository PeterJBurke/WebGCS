# WebGCS Subagent Architecture

## Overview
This document defines the new recommendation-based subagent architecture for WebGCS development. Subagents provide specialized expertise through recommendations rather than direct code implementation.

## Architecture Principles

### Core Concepts
- **Recommendation-Only**: Subagents analyze and recommend, they do not implement
- **Context-Driven**: All decisions based on shared project context
- **Collaborative**: Multiple specialists contribute to complex decisions
- **Traceable**: All recommendations documented and version-controlled

### Communication Pattern
```
1. Lead Agent â†’ Read context.md
2. Lead Agent â†’ Consult Specialist Subagent(s)
3. Subagent â†’ Read context.md + domain recommendations
4. Subagent â†’ Update domain recommendations file
5. Subagent â†’ Update context.md with findings
6. Lead Agent â†’ Review recommendations â†’ Implement
7. Lead Agent â†’ Update context.md with results
```

## File Structure

### Core Files
- `context.md` - Shared project context and current state
- `SUBAGENT_ARCHITECTURE.md` - This architecture document
- `{domain}-recommendations.md` - Individual specialist recommendation files

### Recommendation Files
Each subagent maintains a domain-specific recommendation file:

| File | Specialist | Focus Area |
|------|------------|------------|
| `devops-recommendations.md` | webgcs-devops-expert | CI/CD, deployment, infrastructure |
| `security-recommendations.md` | webgcs-security-expert | Authentication, encryption, hardening |
| `performance-recommendations.md` | webgcs-performance-optimizer | Speed, memory, real-time constraints |
| `realtime-recommendations.md` | webgcs-realtime-expert | MAVLink, WebSocket, threading |
| `frontend-recommendations.md` | webgcs-frontend-specialist | UI/UX, maps, mobile interface |
| `safety-recommendations.md` | webgcs-safety-validator | Flight safety, testing, validation |
| `embedded-recommendations.md` | webgcs-embedded-expert | Raspberry Pi, hardware, optimization |
| `documentation-recommendations.md` | webgcs-documentation-agent | Docs, guides, API reference |

## Subagent Responsibilities

### All Subagents Must
1. **Read context.md** at the start of each consultation
2. **Update their domain recommendation file** with analysis and recommendations
3. **Update context.md** with their findings and dependencies
4. **Consider interdependencies** with other specialists
5. **Prioritize recommendations** by impact and urgency
6. **Maintain recommendation history** for decision tracking

### Recommendation File Structure
Each recommendation file follows this template:

```markdown
# {Domain} Expert Recommendations

## Agent Information
- **Specialist**: {Agent Name}
- **Last Updated**: {ISO Date}
- **Status**: {Ready/Analyzing/Blocked}

## Current Assessment
{Analysis of current state in domain}

## Recommended Actions
### Critical (Immediate Action Required)
### High Priority  
### Medium Priority

## Implementation Considerations
{Technical details, dependencies, risks}

## Dependencies on Other Specialists
{Cross-domain dependencies}

---
*Updated by {agent-name}*
```

## Workflow Patterns

### Single Specialist Consultation
```
Lead Agent â†’ context.md â†’ Specialist Agent â†’ Update recommendations â†’ context.md
```

### Multi-Specialist Collaboration
```
Lead Agent â†’ context.md â†’ {Multiple Specialists in parallel}
Each Specialist â†’ Read context.md + other recommendations â†’ Update own recommendations
Lead Agent â†’ Synthesize recommendations â†’ Implement â†’ Update context.md
```

### Cross-Domain Decision Making
```
1. Lead identifies cross-domain issue
2. Relevant specialists consulted simultaneously  
3. Each specialist considers others' recommendations
4. Specialists update recommendations with dependencies noted
5. Lead resolves conflicts and implements integrated solution
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### For Lead Agents
1. **Always read context.md first** to understand current project state
2. **Identify which specialists** are needed for the current task
3. **Consult specialists in logical order** (security before performance, etc.)
4. **Review all relevant recommendation files** before implementation
5. **Update context.md** with implementation results and lessons learned

### For Specialist Subagents
1. **Read context.md thoroughly** before making recommendations
2. **Review related specialist recommendations** for dependencies
3. **Provide specific, actionable recommendations** with clear priorities
4. **Include implementation complexity estimates** (Low/Medium/High)
5. **Note dependencies on other specialists** explicitly
6. **Update recommendations incrementally** as project evolves

### Recommendation Quality Standards
- **Specific**: Concrete actions, not vague suggestions
- **Prioritized**: Clear urgency and impact levels
- **Contextual**: Consider current project constraints
- **Implementable**: Technically feasible recommendations
- **Safe**: Flight safety considerations for all recommendations

## Decision Resolution

### Conflicting Recommendations
When specialists have conflicting recommendations:
1. **Document the conflict** in context.md
2. **Identify the root cause** of disagreement
3. **Consult additional specialists** if needed
4. **Lead agent makes final decision** based on project priorities
5. **Document resolution rationale** in context.md

### Priority Resolution Matrix
| Safety Impact | Performance Impact | Security Impact | Priority |
|---------------|-------------------|-----------------|----------|
| High | Any | Any | ðŸ”¥ Critical |
| Medium | High | High | ðŸ”¥ Critical |
| Low | High | Medium | âš¡ High |
| Low | Medium | Low | ðŸ“‹ Medium |

## Example Workflows

### Code Quality Improvement Task
```
1. Lead Agent reads context.md
2. Consults: performance-optimizer, realtime-expert, security-expert
3. Performance Optimizer: Identifies telemetry loop inefficiencies
4. Realtime Expert: Recommends debug code cleanup
5. Security Expert: Notes input validation improvements needed
6. Lead Agent: Synthesizes recommendations, implements changes
7. Updates context.md with results
```

### New Feature Implementation
```
1. Lead Agent analyzes feature requirements
2. Consults: frontend-specialist, security-expert, safety-validator
3. Frontend Specialist: UI/UX recommendations
4. Security Expert: Authentication/authorization needs
5. Safety Validator: Safety testing requirements
6. Lead Agent: Coordinates implementation across domains
```

## Version Control and History

### Recommendation Tracking
- Each recommendation file maintains implementation history
- Context.md tracks major project milestones
- Git history provides complete decision audit trail
- Regular snapshot documentation for major releases

### Change Management
```markdown
## Change Log
- 2025-01-24: Initial architecture implementation
- [Future dates]: Major architectural changes
```

## Success Metrics

### Architecture Effectiveness
- **Decision Quality**: Fewer implementation reversals
- **Coordination Efficiency**: Reduced specialist consultation time
- **Knowledge Retention**: Context preserved across sessions
- **Implementation Success**: Higher first-attempt success rate

### Specialist Utilization
- **Coverage**: All major decisions informed by relevant specialists
- **Efficiency**: Minimal redundant consultations
- **Quality**: Specific, actionable recommendations
- **Consistency**: Uniform recommendation quality across specialists
